`pmux` is a transparent drop-in replacement for `tmux` that makes your terminal sessions accessible from your phone. Replace `tmux` with `pmux` in your workflow — every command works identically, but sessions are automatically accessible from the [PocketMux](https://pmux.io) mobile app over an encrypted peer-to-peer connection.

```bash
pmux new-session -s work      # just like tmux, but now accessible from your phone
pmux attach -t work
pmux ls
```

## Highlights

- **Drop-in tmux replacement** — all tmux commands pass through unchanged via a dedicated socket (`-L pmux`)
- **Peer-to-peer encrypted** — terminal data flows directly between host and phone over WebRTC DataChannels; the signaling server never sees your content
- **Zero-knowledge architecture** — the server only relays connection metadata, never terminal data or session information
- **Ed25519 identity** — no passwords, no accounts; cryptographic keypair generated locally at setup
- **QR code pairing** — scan once from the mobile app to establish a secure link
- **OS service integration** — runs as a launchd (macOS) or systemd (Linux) service with automatic restart
- **Cross-platform** — macOS (universal binary) and Linux (amd64, arm64)

## Install

```bash
# Homebrew
brew install shiftinbits/tap/pmux
```

Pre-built binaries and DEB/RPM/Snap packages are available on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ShiftinBits/pmux-agent/releases).

## Getting Started

```bash
pmux init     # generate identity, install service
pmux pair     # scan the QR code with the PocketMux app
pmux          # start a session — it's now on your phone
```
